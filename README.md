1. Data Preparation
a. Data Acquisition
Download Data: Ensure you have the dataset in CSV format. You mentioned it is available via conversion from XLSX to CSV using cloudconvert.
b. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
Outlier Detection: Use outlier detection algorithms to detect and possibly remove outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Summarize the basic features of the data.
Data Visualization: Plot graphs to understand the distribution of each feature and their relationships.
3. Feature Selection
Correlation Matrix: Identify correlations between features and the target variable.
Feature Importance: Use techniques like Random Forest to determine the importance of each feature.
4. Model Building
a. Classification Models
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting
b. Regression Models (if applicable)
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge/Lasso Regression
5. Model Evaluation
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and RMSE, MAE for regression.
6. Model Tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Grid Search or Random Search for tuning hyperparameters.
7. Final Model Selection
Compare Models: Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.
8. Reporting
Visualization of Results: Use plots to present the results of your analysis.
Conclusions: Summarize your findings and insights gained from the analysis.
9. Documentation
Write-up: Document each step of the process, findings, and decisions.
